# Introduction 
Todays blog is about Javascript ES6. ES6 introduces some new concepts which were not covered in the basics of javascript course.

## Difference between using the let and var keyword in the javascript environment
So the main diffence between the let and var keyword is visible when for example the keywords are used inside an if statement or a for loop. When both are defined outside of the function, for loop or if statements they operate as global variables.

## Using the const keyword and mutability
The const keyword is used when the variable being defined will remain unchangable throughout the code. The only time when it becomes changable is when working with arrays. The arrays are mutable and allow the code to be changed.

## Intriducing the Object.freeze() operator for const
The Object.freeze() command can be used when we want the const defined keyword to remain const and also to become immutable.
