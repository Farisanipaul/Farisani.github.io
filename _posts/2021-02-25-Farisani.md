# Introduction
Welcome to another edisode of learning with Farisani. So today we will be doing a lot of Javascript which include how to use for loops, while loops and if statements.

## Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range
Here we learnt about generating a whole number which is between two numbers stated as myMin and myMax. We used a function and created a while loop which generates random numbers until a number between the myMin and myMax is generated. The function will not stop running until all the random numbers generated meet the requirements needed. 

'''function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var testCondition = "false";
  var generateRandom = 0;
  while(testCondition == "false"){
    generateRandom = Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
    if(generateRandom >= myMin && generateRandom <= myMax){
      return generateRandom;
      testCondition = "true";
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}
