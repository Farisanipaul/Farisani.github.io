        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Today I learnt a lot and I was able to identify some of the mistakes I made yesterday. I also learned about adding style to html elements. I also learned new things which inlclude: </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>How to make a shadow around a div tag including images buy using an ancher tag. If you check the imaage and also the text you will notice the boxes and shadows around them</li>
        <li>How to change color of text when hovering over it. Try moving cursor around the title of the blog, the text immediately changes color to red</li>
        <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hovering</h3>
        <p>I realised that not going through an example before answering on freecodecamp becomes a challenge to answer questions. I took my time and learn how to <a href="#">Hover</a> around text elements</p>
        
        <div class="box-shade">
            <h3>Box-Shadow</h3>
            <p>For this part I was able to understand how to make a box and a shadow by going through the example</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Typing</h3>
        <p>I have come to the conclusion that I have to improve my typing skills and as well as use appropriate font and use <em>italics</em> and make words to be <strong>Bold</strong> and also <u>underline</u> and add <s>strikethrough</s> on text</p>
        <h3>Blogging</h3>
        <p>The blogging part is not an easy part as you need to use what you are learning to construct your blog.</p>

      <h2>Challenges faced</h2>
      <p>It took me a very long time to understand how a div works and how to edit it in the style section but I didn't give up on it. I went through the example until I could understand it. After struggling with div I took some time off and practised typing. At first it was easy because I had not included many alphabets but as I added more alphabets I was typing slowly than before but I want to spend more time typing so that I can become better</p>
